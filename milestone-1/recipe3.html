              Each fry is coated in a layer of golden crisp that gives way to a
              soft, welcoming interior. They hit savory and umami with a hint of
              sweetness and they taste like potatoes, oil, and just the right
              amount of salt.

            Instructions
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with 4 cups ice and top with cold water.y</li>
            <li>
              Scrub 2 pounds russet potatoes under running cold water and pat
              dry with paper towels. Using a mandoline set to waffle cut or a
              hand-held crinkle cutter, carefully slice the potatoes to 1/4-inch
              or 1/8-inch thickness. Start the first cut crosswise, then rotate
              the potato 90 degrees in between each cut. Transfer to the ice
              bath and chill for 15 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding each to a small bowl once
              you complete it: Finely grate the zest of 1 lime until you have
              1/2 teaspoon zest; juice the lime until you have 1 tablespoon
              juice; finely mince 1 canned chipotle pepper; add 1 to 2
              tablespoons adobo sauce (depending on your spice preference), 1/2
              cup mayonnaise, and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt; stir to
              combine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground
              black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon garlic
              powder, 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika to a second small bowl and
              whisk to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat 2 quarts vegetable or canola oil into a large Dutch oven over
              medium heat until 260℉. To test if it's hot enough, add a small
              piece of potato. It should sink and tiny bubbles should expel from
              it. Meanwhile, drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water. Lay
              on a clean dish towel (or large sheets of paper towels) and pat
              potatoes dry. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Working in 2 or 3 batches, add the fries and fry, stirring with a
              spider or slotted spoon to prevent sticking, for 3 minutes. The
              potatoes will have no color and will be slightly softened. Using a
              slotted spoon, transfer to the baking sheet and arrange in a
              single layer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase the heat to medium-high and heat the oil to 350℉. To test
              if it's hot enough, add a small piece of potato. It should rise to
              the top and bubble fiercely. Line a second baking sheet with paper
              towels or fit with a wire rack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Working in 2 to 3 batches, fry waffle fries until golden-brown and
              crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to flip individual
              slices to ensure they brown evenly. Transfer to the second baking
              sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle the fries with the spiced salt blend and toss to coat.
              (It may seem like a lot of seasoning, but you will lose some as it
              falls through the holes). Serve with the chipotle-lime mayonnaise
              for dipping.
            </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
